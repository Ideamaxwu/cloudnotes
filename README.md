notes of cloud computing

Virtualization - IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, SECaaS

## Docker
Docker is the world’s leading software container platform. Using containers, everything required to make a piece of software run is packaged into isolated containers. Unlike VMs, containers do not bundle a full operating system - only libraries and settings required to make the software work are needed. This makes for efficient, lightweight, self-contained systems and guarantees that software will always run the same, regardless of where it’s deployed.

Moby is an open framework to assemble specialized container systems without reinventing the wheel. Moby is designed for system builders, who want to build their own container based systems, not for application developers, who can use Docker or other container platforms. 

## OpenStack
OpenStack is a cloud operating system that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter, all managed through a dashboard that gives administrators control while empowering their users to provision resources through a web interface.

## Cloud Foundry
Cloud Foundry is the industry standard open source cloud application platform for developing and deploying enterprise cloud applications. It automates, scales and manages cloud apps throughout their lifecycle. Applications can be written in just about any language and are deployed in container images on any infrastructure.
